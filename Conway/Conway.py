## Overpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies.
## Underpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies.

## Stasis: if a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives.
## Reproduction: if a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it becomes a live cell.

# everything should assume to die unless it has a reason to live.
